# Networking
>A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital 
>interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. The 
>interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based 
>on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network 
>topologies.

>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design.
>The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
