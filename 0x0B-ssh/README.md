# SSH

SSH is a secure protocol used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely. It provides a text-based interface by spawning a remote shell. After connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote server and executed there.
## SSH config file
The contents of the SSH client config file is organized into stanzas (sections). Each stanza starts with the Host directive and contains specific SSH options that are used when establishing a connection with the remote SSH server.
