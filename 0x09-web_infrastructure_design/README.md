## Web stackthe software framework for web development

>A web stack, also called a web application stack, is a compilation of software set up especially for 
>implementing websites and web applications. The term, stack, refers to the fact that the systems individual 
>components are built upon one another. The basic requirements necessary to construct a web stack include: an 
>operating system, a webserver, a database, and a script interpreter. Together with the proper server hardware, 
>this bundle of IT components ensures that necessary information about corresponding web projects is forwarded to 
>requesting clients (generally, this is the internet browser). The browser then processes the HTML, CSS, and 
>JavaScript codes and depicts the web space for the user. Given that a web stacks distinct software components 
>can be individually combined, there are numerous variations possible that can be used for many different 
>application cases. The most popular software combination is the open source bundle LAMP, which is composed of 
>Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
